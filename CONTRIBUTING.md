# How to Contribute

This is an open-source project, so yours contributions are welcomed and needed.

## Did you find a bug?

  * **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/vandorjw/django-assessment/issues).

  * If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/vandorjw/django-assessment/issues/new).
    Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible,
    and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Do you want to write code ?

### Process

  1. [Fork](https://github.com/vandorjw/django-assessment/fork) and clone the repository on Github.
  2. Create a branch based on ``development``.
  3. Write tests.
  4. Develop your code.
  5. Update the documentation if needed.
  6. Push your branch and open a pull-request.

### Conventions

Code conventions are important in a way where they ensure the readability of the code in the time.
The code found here must respect the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008). With a clear and uniform code, the development is better and faster.

### Tests

The submitted code should be covered with one or more unittests to validate correct behavior and to make future development easier.
Without tests, your code cannot be tested for reliability and may not be accepted.
